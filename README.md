# TaskManager
Hi everyone!

This is a Task Manager which was created by myself (Artur Prokopenko).

Here you can use the following functions:

1. View the running processes.
2. Add new processes.
3. Kill some processes (not each process can be killed).
4. Update processes list.

Also the App updates every 10 seconds.

Thank you for watching and good luck!


To preview the running App see example screenshots.
